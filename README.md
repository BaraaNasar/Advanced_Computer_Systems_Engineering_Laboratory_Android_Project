# How to Run Proper Finance App

I (the AI) cannot press the "Run" button for you because I do not have access to your Android Studio interface.

**You must do this:**

1. **Open Android Studio**.
2. **File** -> **Open**.
3. Select this folder: 
   `C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Advanced_Computer_Systems_Engineering_Laboratory_Android_Project`
4. Wait for the loading bar at the bottom to finish.
5. Click the green **Play (Run)** button at the top toolbar.

The code is 100% complete and ready. It just needs you to start it.
